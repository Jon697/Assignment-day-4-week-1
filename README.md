1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery of projects ensures that what the user needs hits or gets to the market as soon as possible so as to be in a position to answer or solve the problems they have or are trying to avoid. Project managers can ensure that projects are met by seeing to it that they follow all the necessary steps in project development such as planning, designing, develpment, testing, launching and maintainace. The working of teams to better enhance this experience is also highly encouraged. 
2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control is everything in a project, as without funds it will be very hard to get the project off the ground. Thus making the best use of a financiers funds is recommended as they will consider you for future project if you turn out to be responsible enough. budget overuns can be avoided by having a systematic plan in place of how the project will be executed. For the best execution its best the project be divided into phases for not only better organisation but for the best efficiency. 
3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is a itarative approach of tackling a software development and even a project as a whole. Each member does a small part then the whole team will bring it together at some point and combine. It encourages flexibility and enhances collaboration. This approach gives the team an exelent time to work together so it enhances their strength as a team. It also gives room for the users to give feedback as its being done in phases. On the down side, it requires one to involve the users so much so as to identify where the problem is. With this method of tackling a problem will make a project run into many problems as you never know when the problems will arise. 
A waterfall methodology approach is more of a step by step way of tackling a project. One phase must be completed before the next phase can be completed, as they are inter related. This method is easy to manage as it is rigid thus when problems occur, thay are easily identifiable and corrected. Once a phase is done, it can be difficult to make changes, plus you only involve the users so late in the project thus it can be impssible to rectify a problem once it arises.
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile can be most appropriate in a food delivery application or an online shopping application as it will involve the buyers using it on a day to day basis thus will see where the problem is and thus give room to the developers to make changes to it. 
A waterfall project methodology can be used in a learning hub website. Such it will only be accessible to the users once it is complete and once it is on a system, it can be very hard to change thus risking its potential to fail. 
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
First and foremost, it is having the right people for the job. With the right team, the probability of things failing is low as every body knows what they are doing and know what is expected of them. Second is ensuring that the right peope are working together to avoid things going south. Its only through team work that they can have a united front towards the direction of the project achieevement. Third, they need the right tools to achieve the set objective. Without the tools nothing is achieveable, it will all end in a disaster. Fourth, a steady source of funds. To ensure that the team has enough funds, will mean that they can work without running into roadblocks of lacking something due to finacial constraints. 
Reasons for maintaining high standard include: 
           A. Shows profesionalism.
           B. Creates an appealing environment to work in.
           C. Increases the motivation of all who are involved.
           D. Ensures success as when problems arise they can be identified easily.
           E.
   6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
